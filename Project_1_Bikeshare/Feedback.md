## Task 1: Regression (10 pts)

### 1) Chronological split with rationale (seasonality/leakage) (2)

- [ ] Fully shown and explained (clear split, rationale addresses seasonality and leakage)
- [ ] Partially shown/explained

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 2) Baseline model and overlay (2)

**Requirement:** Baseline (random guessing), overlay true vs. prediction with per-hour averages.

- [ ] Baseline defined and justified
- [ ] Overlay plot with per-hour averages

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 3) Feature exploration and hour encoding (3)

**Requirement:** Reasoned exploration concluding hour is dominant while others are minor, hour encoded via sine and/or
cosine.

- [ ] Evidence hour is dominant
- [ ] Other features assessed
- [ ] Hour encoded using sine/cosine

**Points (0–3):** __/3

**Feedback:**

### 4) Regularisation test (ridge) and bias argument (1)

**Requirement:** Ridge regularisation tested, argument why effect is negligible here (model bias dominates, not
variance).

- [ ] Ridge tested
- [ ] Bias vs. variance argument made

**Points (0–1):** __/1

**Feedback:**

### 5) Further analysis of the data (2)

**Requirement:** Any additional, relevant analysis beyond the above.

- [ ] Additional analysis present
- [ ] Relevance/insight explained

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

**Subtotal – Task 1:** __/10

## Task 2: Classification (10 pts)

### 1) Feature exploration: (normalised) count informativeness and normalisation to [0, 1] (2)

- [ ] Shows (normalised) count is most informative
- [ ] Demonstrates/how normalisation to [0, 1] is done

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 2) Impact of other features (2)

- [ ] Shows if and how other features affect classification
- [ ] Discussion of observed effects

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 3) Accuracy across splits with class supports, commute/peak hours easier (2)

- [ ] Reports accuracy across defined splits
- [ ] Explains why commute/peak hours are easier

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 4) Optimisation diagnostics (2)

**Requirement:** Loss and Accuracy plots, explain why the loss cannot go lower.

- [ ] Loss and Accuracy plots shown
- [ ] Explanation for optimisation floor

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 5) Mutual information from Pθ(y | x) (2)

**Requirement:** Estimate and/or discussion based on model posteriors Pθ(y | x).

- [ ] MI estimate and/or reasoned discussion
- [ ] Interpretation linked to results

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

**Subtotal – Task 2:** __/10

- [ ] Figures are clear
- [ ] Captions are informative and self-contained
- [ ] Layout is coherent and easy to follow
