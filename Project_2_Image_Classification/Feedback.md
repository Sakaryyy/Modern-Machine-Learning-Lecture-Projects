normalisation, with a short justification of design choices.

- [ ] Design choices briefly justified

**Points (0–2):** __/2

**Feedback:**

### 2) Data split into train, validation and test (1)

- [ ] Split into train, validation and test is clearly described

**Points (0–1):** __/1

**Feedback:**

### 3) Baseline MLP and comparison to simple CNN (4)

**Requirement:** Baseline MLP with one hidden layer on CIFAR10 with description of the network, chosen metric, learning
curves and baseline accuracy. Quantitative comparison to a simple CNN.

### 4) Ablation study of model building blocks (3)

**Requirement:** Ablation study where building blocks are added step by step and their impact on validation performance
is shown in a table or figure and/or discussed.

- [ ] Clear definition of the base model and successive additions
- [ ] Table and or figure that shows validation performance for each variant or something similar
- [ ] Discussion that identifies which components matter and which are less important

**Points (0–3):** __/3

**Feedback:**

### 5) Hyperparameter search (2)

**Requirement:** Hyperparameter search comparing different model sizes, optimisers or settings such as learning rate,
batch size or weight decay through learning curves and final accuracies, with an explanation of how these choices affect
convergence speed and final performance.
